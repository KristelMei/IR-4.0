Cloud Computing (CM): The adoption of cloud computing is on the rise as more companies consider hosting their data systems and applications in the cloud.

Internet of Things (IoT): Industry 4.0 resulted from combining IoT and IoS in manufacturing (Kagermann, Wahlster & Johannes, 2013), with IoT offering enhanced connectivity among systems, objects, and services, enabling data sharing and object-to-object communication.

Additive Manufacturing: Industry 4.0 drives the adoption of advanced data technologies and intelligent production systems, with additive manufacturing as a critical tool. The integration of new manufacturing skills that incorporate information technology is essential for maintaining competitiveness in the economy.

Autonomous Robots: In the future, robots are expected to interact with each other and work closely with humans, guided by handlers, at a lower cost and with more advanced capabilities compared to those currently used in manufacturing.

Simulation: Simulation modeling involves running real or virtual processes to predict the output of a system or process, using real-time data to represent the real world in a simulation model, which can help operators optimize machine settings in a virtual environment, leading to decreased machine setup times and improved quality.

Augmented Reality: Augmented Reality's potential benefits for maintenance works make it a promising investment for tech companies as it can predict accurately and reduce the frequency of maintenance, resulting in cost reduction associated with too much preventive maintenance.

Cyber Security: Cybersecurity involves the use of various technologies, methods, and policies to secure computer networks, systems, and information from unwanted access or attacks to prevent serious consequences.

3D Printing: 3D printing enables the transformation of 3D designs into products without the need for expensive tools or fixtures, thus reducing post-processing, material waste, and human intervention, making it an essential technology for Industry 4.0.

Big Data and Analytics: Under Industry 4.0, big data analytics is crucial for predictive manufacturing and a significant area of industrial technology development due to the rapid growth of the Internet, resulting in vast amounts of data that traditional methods of processing and analysis cannot handle.

System Integration: System integration, a process commonly used in engineering and information technology, combines various computing systems and software packages to create a larger system, driving Industry 4.0 to work at its optimum by increasing the value of a system through the creation of new functionalities.
